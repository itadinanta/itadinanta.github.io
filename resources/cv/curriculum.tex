    \section{Overview}

        \subsection{Profile}
            Versatile, resourceful, polyglot, veteran developer/engineer/programmer experienced in networked console
            games and immersive applications, as individual contributor and team and tech lead.

        \subsection{Objectives}
            My main interests lie in engineering reliable, maintainable, scalable, distributed systems of
            heterogeneous nature. \vspace{0.25em}

            My favourite domains include networked games and digital entertainment, in which I can play production
            and R\&D roles in technical areas, ranging from the likes of hands-on software engineer, programmer,
            problem solver, up to architect, tech, project and team lead, as required by the project at hand.
