title: About me
---

People around me call me Nico. Also known as Nigu, Nico Orru, Mr Orru and even Ms Orru, which is incorrect but I try to be understanding about it.
My birth name is Nicola Orr√π, with nothing in between and an accented "u".

I am British and Italian.

I live in [Liverpool, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) but I was born and bred in sunny [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia).
I have a strong [Sardinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinian_language) accent regardless of the language I'm speaking.

I make PlayStation games with [PlayStation London Studio](https://playstationlondonstudio.com/), from the [PlayStation Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCE_Worldwide_Studios) family. I used to work for [Evolution Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_Studios) and [Studio Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis), before their premature demise.

I have been [programming computers for decades](/resources/curriculum_2018.pdf) and still learning and enjoying it.

The rest of my household is greatly improved by the presence of a lovely lady [programmer](http://www.doppioslash.com/) and a super-friendly fluffy kitten aptly named, after the Twilight Princess, Midna.

and probably a dozen or so of other less beaten paths.
