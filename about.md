People call me Nico.

I am British and Italian.

I live in [Liverpool, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) but I was born and bred in sunny Sardinia.

I make PlayStation games with [Evolution Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_Studios).
I used to work for [Studio Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis).

I have been learning computer programming for thirty years and still enjoy it.

I can be found on:

* [Facebook](https://facebook.com/norru)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nicola_orru)
* [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/norru)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/norru/)
* [PSN](http://eu.playstation.com/psn/profile/Nigu/)

and probably a dozen or so of other less beaten paths.

I have [work history](/resources/curriculum_2015.pdf)
