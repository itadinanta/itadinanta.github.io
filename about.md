title: About me
---

People around me call me Nico. Also known as Nico Orru, Mr Orru and even Ms Orru, which is wrong but I can understand why.
My birth name is Nicola Orrù, with nothing in between and a decorated "u".

I am British and Italian.

I live in [Liverpool, England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool) but I was born and bred in sunny [Sardinia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia).
I have a strong Sardinian accent regardless of the language I'm speaking.

I make PlayStation games with [Evolution Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_Studios).
I used to work for [Studio Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis).

I have been [programming computers for a quarter of a century](/resources/curriculum_2015.pdf) 
and still learning and enjoying it.

The rest of my household is populated by lovely lady [programmers](http://blog.doppioslash.com/about/) and fluffy kittens.

I can be found on:

and probably a dozen or so of other less beaten paths.
