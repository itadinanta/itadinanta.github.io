[Rnkr](http://rnkr.itadinanta.net/) 0.4.0 "sneak peek" has just been released!

Rnkr is a _general purpose leaderboard microservice_ to be integrated as a back-end component behind 
a custom server aggregator (ie your Node.js API).

Not suitable for production yet, but can be easily downloaded and evaluated, following this
[Getting started guide](quickstart).

You're all welcome to try, clone away and respond with suggestions or questions.
