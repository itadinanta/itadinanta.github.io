title: Introduction

Itadinanta is a Sardinian slang word which has no direct translation in any other language. In English it may sound like "what's its name?" and it's generally used as a humorous placeholder for "that bloody thing" when one doesn't remember the thing's name. It had been a running joke between colleagues back then at *Energit*, when, right at the last legs of the dotcom boom, we thought of building a separate startup "to do stuff". Which stuff exactly we really had no idea, hence the name "Itadinanta". For fun, we put together some spare change to buy a domain name, originally "itadinanta.it" and created an email account for each of us.

Unfortunately I almost lost track of those colleagues, needless to say the startup never saw the light of day. Water under bridges and all, however, I became attached to the domain name and to the joke which generated it, and even more than fifteen years and a country switch later I still own the domain name (now it's "itadinanta.net", welcome globalization!) and still enjoy using the name for my own pie-in-the-sky projects.

In this context, "itadinanta" keeps the original meaning of "whatever" but now extends to "whatever" and becomes the moniker for an umbrella covering my personal tech ramblings, maybe something beneficial. These days, it involves dabbling in Scala, functional programming, distributed systems, and generally any technique which makes writing large and reliable systems easier.

At the time of writing (August 2015) there are two public projects under this umbrella:

- [rnkr](http://github.com/itadinanta/rnkr) (reads: ranker). A leaderboard service for videogames. If you think that simple sorted lists are a solved problem for the general case, think again.
- [spring-scala](http://github.com/itadinanta/spring-scala): a fork of the original [springsource project](http://github.com/spring-projects/spring-scala) to extend support to scala 2.11

Enjoy!
