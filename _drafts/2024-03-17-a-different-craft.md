title: A different craft
---

I got busy; a pandemic happened and sort of hopefully tapered down to almost normal; in 2020 I began working remotely,
and never went back to the office, meaning I have been staying at home and reading, writing, building and debugging code
all day. During the long hours in lockdown I wasn't too happy about doing more of the same after work -without the
diversion a different building, or room, or even desk-, so I became less active on the "coding for fun" front. I needed
something different.

As a replacement activity I (re-)discovered **woodworking**.

I started with building a reasonably sized CNC machine in my spare room (yes, it's backwards). First thing, I needed a
workbench to place the machine on. For the machine I had in mind (about 80x70cm not counting cooling module and
electronics), I needed a reasonably sized desk. So, obviously, I converted the metal bunk sofa-bed of the spare room by
replacing the mattress and mattress-holding frame with a 180x100cm pinewood tabletop. This turned out perfect for the
CNC machine and its accessories.

Once I had the CNC machine up and running - which took quite a while to design and put together - I was able to
precisely cut 18mm thick redwood pine timber with relative ease, and started making small furniture and kitchen
accessories with it. CNC allowed for freedom in shape design but was limited in cut size since the working area of that
machine is about 50x50cm. I needed to build something bigger for the house.

Since expanding the CNC machine was not an option, I had to up my handiwork skills and my toolset. A few realisations,
good and bad, shortly appeared:

1. Moving around, cutting and putting back together large and heavy chunks of wood makes for good physical exercise,
   which was great during lockdown

2. Sawing wood produces unexpected amounts of sawdust. Obviously, in hindsight. I was kind of prepared for it since the
   CNC machine does it in first place and I had already built a basic extractor, but as soon as the scale of the project
   goes up, so does the volume of debris

3. The process slows down asymptotically to a halt as the ratio between the size of the things being built and the size
   of the room they are been built in approaches one. This became even worse after I had to make the workshop also my
   working office for privacy reasons. I ended up having to build components in the workshop and assemble them at their
   final destination around the house, aircraft-pipeline style

4. Need for tools whose usefulness and necessity were unimaginable arises. Luckily, those tools do exist and can be
   bought for a reasonable price. On the other hand, the extra room occupied by the new tools exacerbates the problem
   above

5. As machining is removed from the equation, getting sub-millimeter precision requires an inordinate amount of skill
   and patience
